This is a vim edit of the file.txt file. 
Using :set paste will allow you to paste using insert (i).
Pressing enter does take you to a new line.
Pressing ESC will get you back to "normal" mode, and then commands like :q! and :wq! will either 
leave the file without or with saving.
You have to press i or a to insert text though. 


********** Configuration and Context **********

There is a directory called '.kube' that has config stuff in it.

kubectl config -h 
kubectl config get-context
kubectl config use-context
kubectl run ngingx --image=nginx 
"This will create a pod from the docker registry".

You can go into the .kube/config file in the home directory and see API keys and ports and stuff like that.

********** Pods **********

kubectl describe pod <name of pod>
Gives some great information on the pod.

An init container can do something like checking connection statuses, and only if they run successfully will the other pods run. It's good for conditional deployments.

Even though it is not always advised, you can edit the yaml using:
kubectl edit pod ngingx-cw

kubectl run nginx-yaml --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

kubectl run nginx-yaml --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide "this will display a lot more information about the running pods in your namespace."




"executing commands in the pod"
Some pods will have /bin/bash, others will have /bin/sh, others will have /bin/
Use this command to get started: 
kubectl exec -it <name of pod> /bin/bash
Then you will see your cursor at the root of the node
Use exit to leave
