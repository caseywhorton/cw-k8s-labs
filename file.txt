This is a vim edit of the file.txt file. 
Pressing enter does take you to a new line.
Pressing ESC will get you back to "normal" mode, and then commands like :q! and :wq! will either 
leave the file without or with saving.
You have to press i or a to insert text though. 

There is a directory called '.kube' that has config stuff in it.



kubectl config -h 
kubectl config get-context
kubectl config use-context
kubectl run ngingx --image=nginx 
"This will create a pod from the docker registry".
